**Hospital Management System for The Mayo Clinic**

**Description:**

The Mayo Clinic is an American nonprofit academic medical center currently based in three major 
locations, Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Scottsdale, Arizona focused on integrated 
patient care, education, and research. Mayo Clinic holds the number 1 rank among hospitals in the 
United States.

It was opened on the 30th of September 1889. Over the years it grew in size and facilities. It 
increased the size of its premises and also the number of doctors it employs. The vast number of 
patients it treated made management of such a huge hospital an arduous task. The paperwork and 
storing of all patients’ records was becoming unmanageable. It was then the management of the 
hospital decided to invest money in a hospital management software. The Hospital Management 
System is designed to manage all hospital operations.

The 1980s initiated transformative changes that set the course for the modern Mayo Clinic. As an 
early adopter of the Internet, Mayo Clinic has been recognized for its online communications to 
patients.
